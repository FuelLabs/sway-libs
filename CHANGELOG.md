## [Unreleased] - yyyy-mm-dd

Description of the upcoming release here.

### Added

- [#259](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway-libs/pull/259) Adds a new upgradability library, including associated tests and documentation.
- [#265](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway-libs/pull/265) Adds the `SetMetadataEvent` and emits `SetMetadataEvent` when the `_set_metadata()` function is called.

### Changed

- [#265](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway-libs/pull/265) Enables the metadata events now that the Rust SDK supports wrapped heap types.

### Fixed

- [#258](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway-libs/pull/258) Fixes incorrect instructions on how to run tests in README and docs hub.
- [#262](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway-libs/pull/262) Fixes incorrect ordering comparison for IFP64, IFP128 and IFP256.
- [#263](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway-libs/pull/263) Fixes `I256`'s returned bits.
- [#263](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway-libs/pull/263) Fixes `I128` and `I256`'s zero or "indent" value.

#### Breaking

- [#263](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway-libs/pull/263) Removes the `TwosComplement` trait in favor of `WrappingNeg`.
  
The following demonstrates the breaking change. While this example code uses the `I8` type, the same logic may be applied to the `I16`, `I32`, `I64`, `I128`, and `I256` types. 

Before:
```sway
let my_i8 = i8::zero();
let twos_complement = my_i8.twos_complement();
```

After:
```sway
let my_i8 = i8::zero();
let wrapping_neg = my_i8.wrapping_neg();
```
