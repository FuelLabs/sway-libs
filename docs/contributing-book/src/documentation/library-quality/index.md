# Library Quality

The quality of a library can be determined by a variety of measures such as intended utility or adoption. The metric that the following sections will focus on is developer experience.

In the following sections we will take a look at:

- [Library Structure](library-structure/index.md)
  - The file structure and how easily a library may be navigated
- [Code Structure](code-structure.md)
  - How to structure the code inside a file
- [Documentation](documentation/index.md)
  - How to present information about your library
- [Testing](testing.md)
  - The file structure and tips for testing

If the library is well structured, tested and documented then the developer experience will be good.
