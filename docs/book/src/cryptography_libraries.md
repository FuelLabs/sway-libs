# Cryptography Libraries

Cryptography Libraries are any libraries that provided cryptographic functionality beyond what the std-lib provides.

For implementation details on the libraries please see the [Sway Libs Docs](https://fuellabs.github.io/sway-libs/master/sway_libs/).

## Bytecode Library

The [Bytecode](./bytecode/index.md) Library is used for on-chain verification and computation of bytecode roots for contracts and predicates.

## Merkle Library

The [Merkle Proof](./merkle/index.md) Library is used to verify Binary Merkle Trees computed off-chain.
