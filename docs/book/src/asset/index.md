# Asset Library

The Asset Library provides basic helper functions for the [SRC-20; Native Asset Standard](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway-standards/blob/master/SRCs/src-20.md), [SRC-3; Mint and Burn Standard](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway-standards/blob/master/SRCs/src-3.md), and the [SRC-7; Arbitrary Asset Metadata Standard](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway-standards/blob/master/SRCs/src-7.md). It is intended to make development of Native Assets using Sway quick and easy while following the standard's specifications.

For implementation details on the Asset Library please see the [Sway Libs Docs](https://fuellabs.github.io/sway-libs/master/sway_libs/asset/index.html).

## [SRC-20 Functionality](./base.md)

The Base or core of any Asset on the Fuel Network must follow the [SRC-20; Native Asset Standard](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway-standards/blob/master/SRCs/src-20.md). The Asset Library's [Base](./base.md) section supports the [SRC-20](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway-standards/blob/master/SRCs/src-20.md)'s implementation.

## [SRC-3 Functionality](supply.md)

The [SRC-3; Mint and Burn Standard](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway-standards/blob/master/SRCs/src-3.md) prescribes an ABI for how Native Assets on the Fuel Network are minted and burned. The Asset Library's [supply](./supply.md) section supports the [SRC-3](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway-standards/blob/master/SRCs/src-3.md)'s implementation.

## [SRC-7 Functionality](./metadata.md)

The [SRC-7; Arbitrary Asset Metadata Standard](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway-standards/blob/master/SRCs/src-7.md) prescribes an ABI for metadata associated with Native Assets on the Fuel Network. The Asset Library's [metadata](./metadata.md) section supports the [SRC-7](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway-standards/blob/master/SRCs/src-7.md)'s implementation.
