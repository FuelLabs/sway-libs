# Assets Libraries

Asset Libraries are any libraries that use [Native Assets](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/sway/blockchain-development/native_assets) on the Fuel Network.

For implementation details on the libraries please see the [Sway Libs Docs](https://fuellabs.github.io/sway-libs/master/sway_libs/).

## Asset Library

The [Asset](./asset/index.md) Library provides helper functions for the [SRC-20](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway-standards/blob/master/SRCs/src-20.md), [SRC-3](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway-standards/blob/master/SRCs/src-3.md), and [SRC-7](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway-standards/blob/master/SRCs/src-7.md) standards.
