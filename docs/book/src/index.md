# Sway Libraries

The purpose of Sway Libraries is to contain libraries which users can import and use that are not part of the standard library.

These libraries contain helper functions and other tools valuable to blockchain development.

> **NOTE:**
> Sway is a language under heavy development therefore the libraries may not be the most ergonomic. Over time they should receive updates / improvements in order to demonstrate how Sway can be used in real use cases.
