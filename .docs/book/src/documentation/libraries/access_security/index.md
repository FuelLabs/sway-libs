# Access Control and Security Libraries

Access Control and Security Libraries are any libraries that are built and intended to provide additional saftey when developing smart contracts.

## Ownership Library

The [Ownership](./ownership/index.md) Library is used to apply restrictions on functions such that only a **single** user may call them.

## Admin Library

The [Admin](./admin/index.md) Library is used to apply restrictions on functions such that only a select few users may call them like a whitelist.

## Pausable Library

The [Pausable](./pausable/index.md) Library allows contracts to implement an emergency stop mechanism.

## Reentrancy Guard Library

The [Reentrancy Guard](./reentrancy/index.md) Library is used to detect and prevent reentrancy attacks.
