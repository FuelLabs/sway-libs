# Overview

The Unsigned Fixed Point Number library provides a library to use fixed-point numbers in Sway. It has 2 distinct types: `UFP64` and `UFP128`. This type is stack allocated.

This type is stored as a `u64` or `U128` under the hood. Therefore the size can be known at compile time and the length is static. 

For more information please see the [specification](./SPECIFICATION.md).

# Using the Library

## Getting Started

In order to use the `UFP64` or `UFP128` type it must be added to the Forc.toml file and then imported into your Sway project. To add Sway-libs as a dependency to the Forc.toml in your project, please see the [README.md](../../../../../README.md).

```rust
use sway_libs::ufp64::UFP64;
use sway_libs::ufp128::UFP128;
```

Once imported, a `UFP64` or `UFP128` type can be instantiated by defining a new variable and calling the `from` function.

```rust
let mut ufp64_value = UFP64::from(0);
let mut ufp128_value = UFP128::from(0);
```

## Basic Functionality

Basic arithmetic operations are working as usual

```rust
// Add 2 signed values
let ufp_value_3 = ufp_value_1 + ufp_value_2;

// Subtract one signed value from another
let ufp_value_3 = ufp_value_1 - ufp_value_2;
```

Mathematical functions

Exponential Function
```rust
let ten = UFP64::from_uint(10);
let res = UFP64::exp(ten);
```

Square Root function
```rust
let ufp64_169 = UFP64::from_uint(169);
let res = UFP64::sqrt(ufp64_169);
```

Power Function
```rust
let three = UFP64::from_uint(3);
let five = UFP64::from_uint(5);
let res = five.pow(three);
```
