# Overview

This document provides an overview of the Unsigned Fixed Point 64-bit library.

It outlines the use cases, i.e. specification, and describes how to implement the library.

## Use Cases

The Unsigned Fixed Point 64-bit can be used anytime a developer needs fixed-point numbers.

## Public Functions

### `bits()`

The size of this type in bits.

### `max()`

The largest value that can be represented by this fixed-point type.

### `min()`

The smallest value that can be represented by this fixed-point type.

### `round()`

Returns the nearest integer to this fixed-point type. 

### `recip()`

Takes the reciprocal (inverse) of a number, `1/x`.

### `trunc()`

Returns the integer part of a fixed-point number. 

### Basic arithmetic operations

`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`

### Mathematical functions

### `sqrt`

Square root of a fixed-point number.

### `exp`

Exponent of a fixed-point number.

### `pow`

Power of a fixed-point number.
